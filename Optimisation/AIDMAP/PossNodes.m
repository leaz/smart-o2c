function [possnodes] = PossNodes(targets,charvalues)
% This script creates a cell array containing all the unique IDs (UIDs) the
% Physarum algorithm can choose from. 
%
% Inputs:
% * targets    : A cell array with the names of the targets
% * charvalues : A cell array with the possible values each characteristic
%                shown in the unique ID can take. If the possible values for 
%                a characteristic are the same for each target, a vector can 
%                be used. Otherwise, a matrix should be the input. 
%
% Outputs: 
% * possnodes  : A cell array with all the UIDs the algorithm can
%                choose from
