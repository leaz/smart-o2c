%% Fitness Function to be called from the optimization algorithm
%% Evaluates a population of row vectors
function [y Count] = MY_FUNCTION(input_array)
siz = size(input_array,1);
Count = siz ;
y = zeros(siz,1);
for i =1:siz
    y(i,1) =  Fn_Eval(input_array(i,:));
end
end
%% Evaluates a single row vector
function y = Fn_Eval(x)
x=round(x*10000)/10000; %% For fixing the 4 digit precision
y = fn_DED_5(x); %% Change Here to Call a Different System
end
